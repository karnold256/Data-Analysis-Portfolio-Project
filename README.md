Sample Covid Data SQL Queries 
MySql Queries used in the covid dataset

Dsecription
The purpose of this project is to create simple to intermediate mysql queries used to build sample data from a covid dataset.

To run the following queries, one needs MySql database. However, other relational databases can be used depending on what 
works for you. Pratically these have been run and tested on MySql. Nothing complicated as simple functions have been used, 
such as aggregate functions to obtain relevant information needed to create a structured dataset for analysis purposes.
